Shoud they consider using something like "https://mailinator.com/" for this exersize of impersonation?

Yes, they should impliment "Disposable Email" servises in this "assignment"; if we are listing then "https://temp-mail.org/" would be another provider.
==========================================================================================================================================
Not a bad idea if they set up their own mail server, just for this; some sits block popular "mailnator". Mailnator combated tihs by charging a fee for domains other than "mailnator". "temp-mail" did work though, but no saing for how long... While making your own email server might be intimidating to some using a lister site is not, and is much faster than both; making a real fake email, and seting up a server -- be it few lines long.
